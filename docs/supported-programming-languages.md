## Community Supported Languages

What follows is a list of languages, that the community have also made support for, however, their frameworks may be less documented and maintained. If you want to use a language not listed, Nim uses a socket intermediate bot as a bridge between the game and the Nim executable. This can be used by any other language (that can use sockets).
