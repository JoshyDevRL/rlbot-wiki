## Overview

You can make your bot send quickchat! We support sending all standard quickchats, and also some custom ones! You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/blob/master/src/main/flatbuffers/rlbot.fbs#L376).

It's now possible to read quick chat too, assuming the framework for your chosen language has added support. You'll be able to read the chat log regardless of what language send the message. Messages sent on the team-only channel will be hidden from opponents appropriately.

Using quick chat is a little different in each language, see the specific links below.
