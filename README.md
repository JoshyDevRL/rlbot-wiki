# RLBot central wiki

## Setup

For linux (windows is probably very similar):

```bash
python -m venv venv # Create virtual env for python
source venv/bin/activate # Activate virtual env
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install mkdocs
```

Refer to `mkdocs --help` for serving locally, building and deploying

## Todo

- [X] Move all* pages from RLBot/RLBot wiki (*see docs/missing-pages.md)
- [ ] Move language specific wikis
- [X] Sort pages into categories
